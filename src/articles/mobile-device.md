# SigmaStamp on the phone or tablet

You are on the mobile device and unfortunatelly SigmaStamp needs to have installed [Nautilus Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nautilus-wallet/gjlmehlldlphhljhpnlddaodbjjcchai/related) webextension which is not available on the phone.

You can still show the [oracle page](/oracles), [verify documents](/verify), or read [FAQ](/faq) or [wiki](/wiki).
